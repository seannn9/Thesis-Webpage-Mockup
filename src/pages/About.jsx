                <p>
                    Plants are the cornerstone of life on Earth, providing us
                    with the essential elements for survival: oxygen, food, and
                    a multitude of other resources. Optimizing plant growth is
                    not only crucial for ensuring global food security but also
                    vital for maintaining a healthy and balanced environment.
                    This research is established with concern about plant growth
                    stages and the environmental requirements necessary for
                    successful cultivation.

                    It is difficult to achieve consistent and optimal growth
                    results because growers often rely on trial-and-error
                    approaches (Smith, 2019). Cultivating plants requires a
                    delicate balance of various environmental factors, including
                    temperature, humidity, and light availability (Garcia &
                    Lopez, 2021). Manually monitoring and adjusting these
                    factors can be time-consuming and prone to human error,
                    potentially leading to suboptimal growth conditions (Smith,
                    2019).

                    Existing automated systems for plant growth offer some level
                    of automation but may have limitations. In a study by Cruz,
                    Lazaro & Peralta (2023), it stated that adding more
                    features, improving the reading, and making it more
                    versatile may improve the system. The same can be said in a
                    study by Miller et al., (2020), these limitations involved
                    restricted functionalities, data handling capacity
                    constraints, and potential inaccuracies in measuring plant
                    development. And while these systems offer some advantages,
                    they may not provide the level of control, fast data
                    analysis, or user-friendliness required by growers of all
                    experience levels (Miller et al., 2020).
